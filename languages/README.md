# Notice! Do not place your custom translation files here.

Edition Tirol Shopdesign will look in this directory for translations as a fallback. If you're using one of the bundled translations without any edits this is fine. However, if you make any customisations they will be overwritten during updates. Instead, use the global WordPress language directory and install your translations like so: `/wp-content/languages/themes/et_shop-it_IT.mo`.

Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/it_IT.mo`.
